/* Synthetic-output pacing.
 *
 * uinput gives the producer no backpressure: write() always succeeds, and when
 * a consumer's per-fd evdev ring fills (≈64 events on a typical keyboard) the
 * kernel discards queued events and raises SYN_DROPPED on *that consumer*. A
 * back-to-back burst (e.g. a long Send) therefore silently loses keystrokes —
 * the compositor never gets a chance to drain between our writes.
 *
 * Since the overflow cannot be observed from here, the practical mitigation is
 * to keep the number of in-flight (un-drained) events safely below the ring and
 * briefly yield so the consumer's event loop runs. We count emitted events and
 * clock_nanosleep() once a chunk's worth has been written. The check runs after
 * every event (not per high-level input), so the chunk size IS the per-cycle
 * footprint — there is no extra overshoot from a single input expanding into a
 * burst (e.g. a Unicode char ≈32 events).
 *
 * Smaller, more frequent pauses tolerate delayed consumer scheduling better
 * while preserving the same nominal throughput. Short sends never reach the
 * threshold and pay nothing, so the common case runs at full speed.
 *
 * The counter is SHARED across every output path that runs on the sequencer
 * thread -- bulk client synthesis AND single-event passthrough replay -- and
 * PERSISTS across back-to-back emits rather than resetting per batch. This is
 * what lets replay be paced: a passthrough replay is one event per call, so a
 * per-batch reset would keep it forever below the threshold, but a *sustained*
 * burst (mouse REL motion floods, key autorepeat, several grabbed devices
 * interleaving) is a stream of such calls arriving back-to-back on the one
 * sequencer thread and can overflow the consumer ring exactly like a long Send.
 * By carrying the counter across calls, that stream accumulates and paces the
 * same way synthesis does.
 *
 * Isolated input must stay free (no per-keystroke latency), so the counter is
 * reset whenever the gap since the previous emit exceeds KSI_SYNTH_PACE_IDLE_
 * RESET_NS: an idle gap that long means the consumer has had ample time to
 * drain, so nothing we sent is still in flight and the next event starts a
 * fresh chunk. A single passed keystroke (or one every few hundred ms) therefore
 * never accumulates toward the threshold and never sleeps, while a genuine
 * sub-millisecond flood does. The gap-based reset also spaces successive client
 * Sends: two Sends separated by human-scale time each start fresh, exactly as
 * the old per-batch reset did. */
